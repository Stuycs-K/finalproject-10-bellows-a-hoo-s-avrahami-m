# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

# Intentions:

We aim to create a social manipulation based viral tool to accomplish privledge escalation on a target computer. The virus will behave like another program with an anoculous purpose and implant an alias to the virus. The next time the user runs sudo the virus will steal the sudo passwd and use it to both do the sudo cmd of the user and relaunch the virus with sudo privleges. If the user is not rootable the virus will begin privledge escalation.
    
# Intended usage:

It will be a viral system used to gain high level access on a target system. It will also illistrate a potential security flaw that stems from easily writable rc files.

# Technical Details:

- We will alias sudo to be our program.
- we will use privlege escalation methods to gain root level access as we gain more passwords
- we will use a remote file server to recieve the username and password and to serve requests. 
- we will edit configuration files and attempt to steal high value cards
  
    
# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
